### ViperExample 

This repo serves as an example to how an iOS app can be structured according to the VIPER architecture. 
Some minor liberties have been taken when applying the architecture with the goal to make the codebase more straightforward and 
better maintainable.

Hop between the second and the third commit to see how the app is structured according to the MVC and the VIPER architecture.
